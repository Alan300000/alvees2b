<!-- **ximyer/ximyer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... About Feminism in Literature and Stem Fields!
- ğŸ“š I'm currently reading: _The Handmaid's Tale_ by Margaret Atwood and _The Radium Girls_ by Kate Moore.

- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I was named 'Yeraldin' after the American actress Geraldine Chaplin, but I was curiously born on the same day as her father, Charles Chaplin (April 16th).
